# Video for the blind

## Project goal
This project aims to broaden the world for highly visually imparied people by giving them more information on video content on the internet. 
We want to motivate people all around the world the stand by a good cause and be part of this revolutionary movement that will make life of blind people better.

## Background
Our world is becoming digital with an incredible speed. Some say printed media is dying and we can see that people are reading more and more news on the internet. Taking one more step further, we believe video will start to be favoured over written materials and publishers will create more and more multimedia, especially video content. 

We want to help the world to get prepared to serve the blind with proper video material. There are already standards supporting additional narrative tracks on video content, however it is not wide-spread at all online, and majority of the currently available content lacks supporting this. 

Please take a moment and watch a random short 1-2 minute video on YouTube with your eyes shut. When the video has finished playing describe what happened on the video. Watch the video again and you’ll be shocked how much additional information you have of you add the visual information. 

Not all people are as lucky to enjoy this, according to the WHO “285 million people are estimated to be visually impaired worldwide: 39 million are blind and 246 have low vision.” that is 4% of the world’s population. 

Our project will start up a video platform which is going to contain videos which either have an additional narrative audio track giving detailed additional information or a text based script, preferably both. Having this, blind people may watch the video listening to the additional narration, or reading it with a Braille display. We wish this platform to became a “tool of independence” which means blind people shall be able to find informative and entertaining video content without additional help sitting next to them. In case of deafblindness we could also call it an additional gateway to the outer world.
